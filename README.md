## Getting Started

### Docker Image (`amd64`, `arm` and `arm64`)

You can try [**AutoMoLi**](https://github.com/benleb/ad-automoli) via [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/benleb/automoli) without installing anything! The Image is the default [AppDaemon](https://github.com/AppDaemon/appdaemon) one with AutoMoLi and a simple default configuration added. See the [AppDaemon Docker Tutorial](https://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/DOCKER_TUTORIAL.html) on how to use it in general.  

[**AutoMoLi**](https://github.com/benleb/ad-automoli) expects motion sensors and lights including a `room` name. The exact patterns are listed in [Auto-Discovery of Lights and Sensors](https://github.com/benleb/ad-automoli#auto-discovery-of-lights-and-sensors) You can set a `room` with the **AUTOMOLI_ROOM** variable in the Docker *run* command.

```bash
docker run --rm --interactive --tty --name AutoMoLi \
--env HA_URL="<HA URL>" \
--env TOKEN="<HA Token>" \
--env AUTOMOLI_ROOM="bathroom" \
--ports 5050:5050 \
benleb/automoli:latest
```

Port 5050 is opened to give access to the AppDaemon Admin-UI at <http://127.0.0.1:5050>

#### Example

To test AutoMoLi in your **Esszimmer** (german for dining room), use `... --env AUTOMOLI_ROOM="esszimmer" ...` in the Docker *run* command.

* AppDaemon will show you its config file on startup: ![cfg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benleb/ad-automoli/master/.github/cfg.png)

* If everything works, AutoMoLi will show you the configuration it has parsed, including the discovered sensors: ![cfg-loaded](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benleb/ad-automoli/master/.github/cfg_loaded.png)

* This is how it looks when AutoMoLi manages your lights: ![running](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benleb/ad-automoli/master/.github/run.png)

## Installation

Use [HACS](https://github.com/hacs/integration) or [download](https://github.com/benleb/ad-automoli/releases) the `automoli` directory from inside the `apps` directory here to your local `apps` directory, then add the configuration to enable the `automoli` module.

### Example App Configuration

Add your configuration to appdaemon/apps/apps.yaml, an example with two rooms is below.

```yaml
livingroom:
  module: automoli
  class: AutoMoLi
  room: livingroom
  disable_switch_entities:
    - input_boolean.automoli
    - input_boolean.disable_my_house
  delay: 600
  daytimes:
      # This rule "morning" uses a scene, the scene.livingroom_morning Home Assistant scene will be used
    - { starttime: "sunrise", name: morning, light: "scene.livingroom_morning" }

    - { starttime: "07:30", name: day, light: "scene.livingroom_working" }

      # This rule"evening" uses a percentage brightness value, and the lights specified in lights: below will be set to 90%
    - { starttime: "sunset-01:00", name: evening, light: 90 }

    - { starttime: "22:30", name: night, light: 20 }

      # This rule has the lights set to 0, so they will no turn on during this time period
    - { starttime: "23:30", name: more_night, light: 0 }

  # If you are using an illuminance sensor you can set the lowest value here that blocks the lights turning on if its already light enough
  illuminance: sensor.illuminance_livingroom
  illuminance_threshold: 100

  # You can specify a light group or list of lights here
  lights:
    - light.livingroom

  # You can specify a list of motion sensors here
  motion:
    - binary_sensor.motion_sensor_153d000224f421
    - binary_sensor.motion_sensor_128d4101b95fb7

  # See below for info on humidity
  humidity:
    - sensor.humidity_128d4101b95fb7


bathroom:
  module: automoli
  class: AutoMoLi
  room: bathroom
  delay: 180
  motion_state_on: "on"
  motion_state_off: "off"
  daytimes:
    - { starttime: "05:30", name: morning, light: 45 }
    - { starttime: "07:30", name: day, light: "scene.bathroom_day" }
    - { starttime: "20:30", name: evening, light: 100 }
    - { starttime: "sunset+01:00", name: night, light: 0 }

  # As this is a bathroom there could be the case that when taking a bath or shower, motion is not detected and the lights turn off, which isnt helpful, so the following settings allow you to use a humidity sensor and humidity threshold to prevent this by detecting the humidity from the shower and blocking the lights turning off.
  humidity:
    - sensor.humidity_128d4101b95fb7
  humidity_threshold: 75

  lights:
    - light.bathroom
    - switch.plug_68fe8b4c9fa1
  motion:
    - binary_sensor.motion_sensor_158d033224e141
  # For the bathroom leave the light on as long as the door is closed
  door:
    - binary_sensor.bathroom_door
  # Optional : When the door opens turn off the light after specified delay
  door_open_delay: 10
```

## Auto-Discovery of Lights and Sensors

[**AutoMoLi**](https://github.com/benleb/ad-automoli) is built around **rooms**. Every room or area in your home is represented as a seperate app in [AppDaemon](https://github.com/AppDaemon/appdaemon) with separat light setting. In your configuration you will have **one config block** for every **room**, see example configuration.  
For the auto-discovery of your lights and sensors to work, AutoMoLi expects motion sensors and lights including a **room** name (can also be something else than a real room) like below:

* *sensor.illumination_`room`*
* *binary_sensor.motion_sensor_`room`*
* *binary_sensor.motion_sensor_`room`_something*
* *light.`room`*

AutoMoLi will detect them automatically. Manually configured entities will take precedence, but **need** to follow the naming scheme above.

## Configuration Options

key | optional | type | default | description
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
`module` | False | string | automoli | The module name of the app.
`class` | False | string | AutoMoLi | The name of the Class.
`room` | False | string | | The "room" used to find matching sensors/light
`disable_switch_entities` | True | list/string | | One or more Home Assistant Entities as switch for AutoMoLi. If the state of **any** entity is *off*, AutoMoLi is *deactivated*. (Use an *input_boolean* for example)
`only_own_events` | True | bool | | Track if automoli switched this light on. If not, an existing timer will be deleted and the state will not change
`disable_switch_states` | True | list/string | ["off"] | Custom states for `disable_switch_entities`. If the state of **any** entity is *in this list*, AutoMoLi is *deactivated*. Can be used to disable with `media_players` in `playing` state for example.
`disable_hue_groups` | False | boolean | | Disable the use of Hue Groups/Scenes
`delay` | True | integer | 150 | Seconds without motion until lights will switched off. Can be disabled (lights stay always on) with `0`
~~`motion_event`~~ | ~~True~~ | ~~string~~ | | **replaced by `motion_state_on/off`**
`daytimes` | True | list | *see code* | Different daytimes with light settings (see below)
`transition_on_daytime_switch` | True | bool | False | directly activate a daytime on its start time (instead to just set it as active daytime used if lights are switched from off to on)
`lights` | True | list/string | *auto detect* | Light entities
`motion` | True | list/string | *auto detect* | Motion sensor entities
`illuminance` | True | list/string |  | Illuminance sensor entities
`illuminance_threshold` | True | integer |  | If illuminance is *above* this value, lights will *not switched on*
`humidity` | True | list/string |  | Humidity sensor entities
`humidity_threshold` | True | integer |  | If humidity is *above* this value, lights will *not switched off*
`motion_state_on` | True | integer | | If using motion sensors which don't send events if already activated, like Xiaomi do, add this to your config with "on". This will listen to state changes instead
`motion_state_off` | True | integer | | If using motion sensors which don't send events if already activated, like Xiaomi do, add this to your config with "off". This will listen to the state changes instead.
`door` | True | list/string | | Door close sensor, light will not turn off when door is closed
`door_open_delay` | True | integer | | Override normal delay when door is opened
`debug_log` | True | bool | false | Activate debug logging (for this room)

### daytimes

key | optional | type | default | description
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
`starttime` | False | string | | Time this daytime starts or sunrise|sunset [+|- HH:MM]
`name` | False | string | | A name for this daytime
`delay` | True | integer | 150 | Seconds without motion until lights will switched off. Can be disabled (lights stay always on) with `0`. Setting this will overwrite the global `delay` setting for this daytime.
`light` | False | integer/string | | Light setting (percent integer value (0-100) in or scene entity
